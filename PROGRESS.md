# Tutor Platform API - Progress Tracking

## Project Overview
Building a NestJS backend API POC for a tutoring platform with:
- JWT authentication (access/refresh tokens)
- Multi-user meetings using OpenVidu
- Recording management
- PostgreSQL database

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Day 1: Core Infrastructure
- **[✅] NestJS Project Setup**
  - TypeScript configuration with proper build settings
  - TypeORM integration with PostgreSQL
  - Swagger documentation setup
  - Environment configuration following example patterns

- **[✅] Authentication Module**
  - JWT auth service with access/refresh token generation
  - Local, JWT, and JWT refresh strategies
  - Auth guards and decorators
  - Signin and refresh token endpoints
  - Custom decorators for auth user extraction

- **[✅] Users Module**
  - User entity with UUID primary key, email uniqueness, role enum
  - User service with CRUD operations
  - User registration endpoint
  - User response DTOs with proper serialization

- **[✅] Database Infrastructure**
  - Docker Compose setup with PostgreSQL and Adminer
  - Environment variables configuration
  - Database migration scripts setup
  - Initial migration generated and executed

### Day 2: Database & Entities
- **[✅] Entity Creation**
  - User entity (id, email, password, role, timestamps)
  - Meeting entity (id, title, sessionId, status, createdBy, timestamps)
  - Recording entity (id, s3Url, duration, status, meetingId, createdAt)
  - Proper relationships and foreign keys

- **[✅] Database Schema**
  - Migration generation fixed with proper paths
  - All tables created successfully:
    - `users` with role enum (admin/user)
    - `meetings` with status enum (active/ended/recording)
    - `recordings` with status enum (processing/ready/failed)
  - Foreign key constraints established

- **[✅] Development Tools**
  - Package.json scripts for TypeORM migrations
  - Build configuration optimized (webpack disabled for multiple files)
  - Nest CLI configuration (spec generation disabled)

### Day 3: Authentication & Response System
- **[✅] Authentication System**
  - JWT auth with access/refresh tokens (15m/7d)
  - bcrypt password hashing with configurable salt rounds
  - Local, JWT, and JWT refresh strategies
  - Auth guards and decorators
  - Signin and refresh token endpoints
  - Custom decorators for auth user extraction

- **[✅] Response DTO Pattern**
  - `@UseResponse(ResponseClass)` decorator for automatic transformation
  - `PlainToResponseInterceptor` for DTO conversion
  - Global `excludeAll` strategy with `@Expose()` decorators
  - Clean controllers returning raw entities
  - No need for `@Exclude()` at class level

- **[✅] Security Features**
  - Password hashing with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
  - JWT token validation and refresh
  - Proper error handling for invalid credentials
  - Protected endpoints with Bearer token authentication

### Day 4: OpenVidu & Meetings Integration
- **[✅] OpenVidu Service (LiveKit SDK)**
  - Migrated to `livekit-server-sdk` (OpenVidu 3.x uses LiveKit)
  - Room management: create, delete, list
  - Token generation with participant identity
  - Proper configuration from environment variables

- **[✅] Meetings Module**
  - Meeting service with full CRUD operations
  - Create meeting endpoint (admin only) - creates LiveKit room
  - List all meetings endpoint
  - Get meeting by ID endpoint
  - Join meeting endpoint - generates LiveKit access token
  - End meeting endpoint (admin/creator only) - deletes LiveKit room
  - Meeting response DTOs with proper serialization
  - Status management (active/ended/recording)
  - Authorization checks (admin/creator permissions)

---

## 🔄 In Progress

### Recording Management
- Recording entity exists but no service/controller implementation
- Need start/stop recording endpoints
- Need recording list and status management

---

## 📋 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Recording Management
- **[⏳] Recording Module**
  - Recording service for start/stop operations
  - Start recording endpoint (admin/creator)
  - Stop recording endpoint (admin/creator)
  - List recordings endpoint
  - Recording status updates (processing/ready/failed)
  - S3 URL management

### Phase 2: Additional Features
- **[⏳] Meeting Participants**
  - Track active participants in meetings
  - Leave meeting endpoint (optional, mostly client-side)
  - Participant list endpoint

### Phase 3: Documentation & Testing
- **[⏳] API Documentation**
  - Comprehensive Swagger documentation
  - Endpoint examples and testing
  - Authentication flow documentation

---

## 🛠️ Technical Notes

### Environment Configuration
- Database: PostgreSQL (localhost:5432)
- OpenVidu: https://for-test.click (credentials in .env)
- JWT: Access token 15m, Refresh token 7d
- AWS S3: Configured for recording storage

### Database Schema
```sql
users (id, email, password, role, created_at, updated_at)
meetings (id, title, session_id, status, created_by_id, created_at, updated_at)
recordings (id, s3_url, duration, status, meeting_id, created_at)
```

### Key Files Created
- `src/entities/*.entity.ts` - Database entities
- `src/modules/auth/` - Authentication system (✅ Complete)
- `src/modules/users/` - User management (✅ Complete)
- `src/modules/openvidu/` - LiveKit/OpenVidu integration (✅ Complete)
- `src/modules/meetings/` - Meeting management (✅ Complete)
- `src/decorators/` - Custom decorators (UseResponse, AuthUser, WithAuth)
- `src/interceptors/` - Response transformation interceptors
- `src/config/` - Configuration files
- `src/db/ormconfig.ts` - TypeORM configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Local infrastructure
- `.env` - Environment variables

## 🎯 Current Status
**Phase**: Meetings Module Complete ✅
**Next**: Recording Management  
**Estimated Completion**: Day 4-5

Core meeting functionality with LiveKit integration is production-ready. Users can create meetings, join with tokens, and end meetings. Recording management is the final major feature.
